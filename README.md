# K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-Python-Implementation
This is a native implementation of K Means Clustering with comparison of Scikit-Learn Python. Tested on Daily Weather Dataset <br>

We will use cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. In this dataset, we have in the order of millions records. We are using a small subset of data, You can obtain original dataset from here<br>

<br>

## What is in the Project

*  daily_weather.cv (dataset)
*  Jupyter Notebook
*  .py file (contains function for user)

## Scaling of Data
Data is scaled using scikit-learn StanderdScaller

## Distance Measurement
Euclidean Distance is used to calculate the distance between observations

## Evaluation Metrics
We are using Sum of Square Error Method to evaluate cluster.
